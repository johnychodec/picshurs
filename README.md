## Why Picshurs?

- **No cloud, no lock-in.** Your photos and videos live on your disk. Picshurs reads them in place and never moves, copies, or uploads anything unless you ask.
- **Non-destructive photo editing.** Crop, straighten, adjust brightness/contrast/saturation, apply filters — originals are never modified. Edits are saved as tiny sidecar files and can be undone anytime.
- **Fast at scale.** Designed for 10,000+ item libraries. The grid renders from a local SQLite index in milliseconds; filesystem scanning happens in the background.
- **Keyboard-driven.** Nearly every action has a shortcut.

## Evolution

Picshurs is a spiritual successor to Google's Picasa, carrying forward its philosophy of simple, local photo management while modernizing the approach for today's workflows.

## Features

### Browse & Organize
- Add any folder to your library — including external drives and NAS mounts
- Automatic indexing with filesystem monitoring (new/changed files detected automatically)
- 8-color dot tagging system (virtual albums without moving files)
- Media tray: pin, reorder, and batch-export a curated selection
- Marquee drag selection across all grid modes
- Sort by name, date, or file size
- Full-text search by filename, folder name, or **text recognized inside photos** (OCR)
- Videos appear beside photos with poster thumbnails and play badges
- Show or hide videos from **Settings → General → Browsing** without rescanning
- Share files via the standard macOS share sheet
- Quick Look integration (`Cmd+Y`)

### Discover
- **People** *(experimental, off by default)* — on-device face detection groups photos by who's in them. Name, merge, and hide people; everything runs locally with Apple's Vision framework.
- **Map** — geotagged photos plotted on an interactive MapKit map.
- **Text in photos** — opt-in OCR indexes the text inside your images so search can find signs, screenshots, and documents.

### Edit
- Photo editing only; videos and RAW files remain view-only
- Brightness, contrast, exposure, saturation, shadows, sharpness sliders
- Color temperature and tint
- Auto Contrast, Auto Color, and "I'm Feeling Lucky" one-click enhance
- Crop with aspect ratio presets (Free, Original, 1:1, 4:6, 5:7, 8:10, 16:9)
- Straighten with auto-zoom (no black corners)
- 28 creative filters across three categories
- Stackable adjustment layers in user-chosen order
- 50-level undo/redo per photo
- Save to original (with automatic backup) or export edited copy

### Export
- Batch export with customizable filename templates (`{n}`, `{name}`, `{date}`, `{today}`)
- Separate last-used templates per export type
- Live filename preview in the export panel
- Export photos without metadata (strips EXIF/GPS/XMP for privacy)
- Web-optimized photo export (resize + compress + strip metadata)
- Duplicate and move operations with progress feedback

### Supported Formats

| Format | View | Edit / Export |
|--------|------|---------------|
| JPEG | ✅ | ✅ |
| PNG | ✅ | ✅ |
| HEIC/HEIF | ✅ | ✅ |
| TIFF | ✅ | ✅ |
| WebP | ✅ | View only |
| BMP, GIF | ✅ | View only |
| RAW (CR2, NEF, ARW, DNG, ORF, PEF, RAF, RW2, SR2, X3F) | ✅ | View only |
| Video (MP4, MOV, M4V, AVI, MTS/M2TS, 3GP) | Poster thumbnail + default player | Original-file actions only |

RAW files display with a "RAW" badge in the grid. Editing is not supported for RAW — use your RAW processor of choice and re-import the result.

Videos display with a play badge and open inside the same gallery flow as photos. Click the large video poster to launch the file in your macOS default video player. Video editing, trimming, and transcoding are out of scope.

## Requirements

- **macOS 14 Sonoma** or later
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) or Intel Mac

## Installation

### Download (pre-built DMG)

1. Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Open the DMG and drag **Picshurs** into **Applications**
3. On first launch, right-click the app and choose **Open** — or clear Gatekeeper quarantine in Terminal:

```sh
xattr -cr /Applications/Picshurs.app
```

### Build from Source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/johnychodec/picshurs.git
cd picshurs
swift build -c release
```

The binary is at `.build/release/Picshurs`. To create a proper `.app` bundle:

```sh
mkdir -p Picshurs.app/Contents/{MacOS,Resources}
cp .build/release/Picshurs Picshurs.app/Contents/MacOS/
cp Sources/Resources/Info.plist Picshurs.app/Contents/
cp Sources/Resources/AppIcon.icns Picshurs.app/Contents/Resources/
xattr -cr Picshurs.app
```

## Quick Start

1. Launch Picshurs
2. Add folders to your library — open **Settings → Library**, click **+** to browse and add watched folders. Toggle **Include Subfolders** to scan recursively. Picshurs indexes everything in the background.
3. Browse, select, and tag — your library builds automatically. Use the sidebar to switch between All Photos, years, or source folders. Assign color dots (`Opt+1`–`8`) to create virtual albums without moving files. Use **Settings → General → Browsing → Show videos** to include or hide videos.
4. Double-click a photo or video to open the gallery. Photos can enter edit mode with **E**; videos show a poster frame, and clicking the poster opens your default video player.
5. **The Tray** — a persistent selection strip at the bottom of the window. Pin items with **P**, drag to reorder, then batch-export, duplicate, move, or delete the entire set. Tray size and row count are adjustable in **Settings → General → Tray**. The tray survives across sessions — your curated picks stay put until you unpin them.

## How Data is Stored

| Data | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Media index | `~/Library/Application Support/Picshurs/picshurs.sqlite` | Rebuilt automatically from your folders |
| Edit sidecars | `~/Library/Application Support/Picshurs/edits/` | JSON files, one per edited photo |
| Thumbnail cache | `~/Library/Caches/com.picshurs.thumbnails/` | Safe to delete — rebuilt on demand |
| Settings | macOS UserDefaults | Standard preferences system |

**Your photos and videos are never copied into or managed by the app.** Deleting the app or its support files does not affect your files.

## Architecture

Picshurs follows a **lightweight MVVM pattern** using Swift's `@Observable` macro. The architecture is built around a few core principles:

- **Single source of truth** — `AppViewModel` holds all UI state
- **Persistence-first** — Media metadata lives in SQLite (GRDB); settings in `UserDefaults`
- **Actor-isolated services** — I/O-heavy work (thumbnails, filesystem scanning, database writes) runs in Swift actors to avoid data races
- **Declarative UI** — Views observe state via `@Environment` and `@Bindable`

### Data Flow

```
User Input → AppViewModel (@Observable) → SwiftUI Views
                    ↓
            Service Layer (Actors)
     ┌──────────┼──────────┐
     ↓          ↓          ↓
PhotoIndexer  Thumbnail   ImageProcessor
     ↓       Service       (Core Image)
DatabaseManager
   (GRDB SQLite)
```

### Tech Stack

- **Swift 5.9+** / **SwiftUI** (macOS 14+)
- **GRDB.swift** — SQLite database (sole external dependency)
- **Core Image** — GPU-accelerated editing pipeline
- **Vision** — on-device face detection/clustering and text recognition (OCR)
- **MapKit** — geotagged-photo map
- **ImageIO** — Thumbnail generation, EXIF + GPS metadata extraction
- **QuickLookThumbnailing** — RAW, video, and exotic format thumbnail fallback

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| GRDB over Core Data | Raw SQL power, lightweight, no object graph complexity |
| `@Observable` over `ObservableObject` | Granular property-level updates, no `Combine` boilerplate |
| `struct PhotoItem` over `class` | Value semantics prevent stale-reference bugs; replacement pattern triggers SwiftUI reactivity |
| Actors for services | Prevent data races on internal caches and database queues |
| JSON sidecars for edits | Portable, human-readable, version-control friendly |
| DB-first browsing | Grid renders from SQLite instantly (~10ms); filesystem scanning runs in background |
